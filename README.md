# ML App Development ðŸ–¥
Tools Used: Python, Streamlit, and Joblib
- `/Data` contains CSV files for tables and the previously developed ML Models
- `/Components` contains pages for the app (finance analysis, seo analysis, and about)
- `app.py` contains the main section for the app such as navigation and page routing
- `multiapp.py` contains the code used to build multiple pages with Streamlit
